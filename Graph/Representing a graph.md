# Nodes as objects and edges as pointers

* Time complexity: O(n) to access a node
* Memory complexity: O(n) for node, O(n^2) for pointers
* The object/pointer model works better with directed graphs than undirected graphs because the pointers would need to be maintained in pairs,

# Matrix(Two-dimension array)

* Memory complexity: O(n^2)
* Time complexity: O(1)
* more easily to graphs with weighted edges

# Adjacency list

* A master list of all the vertices in the Graph object
* Each vertices maintains connections as a dictionary or a linked list
