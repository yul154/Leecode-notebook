>Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

>String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

>Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Code:
```
s=list(s)
        t=list(t)
        for i in s:
            if i in t:
                t.remove(i)
                
        return ''.join(t)
```

```
from collections import Counter
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
ds=Counter(s)
dt=Counter(t)
list((dt-ds).keys()).pop()
```
