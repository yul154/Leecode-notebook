>Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

>Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

>You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

# Example
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]

Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also right

# Code
```
odd = [x for x in A if x % 2 == 1]
even = [x for x in A if x % 2 == 0]
n=[item for A in zip(even, odd) for item in A]
return [item for A in zip(even, odd) for item in A]
```
# Mark points
1. convert a list of lists to a one-dimensional listï¼š[item for A in zip(even, odd) for item in A]
